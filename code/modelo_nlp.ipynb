Check in was a little more difficult than some places, but Jason makes it very clear to review the details of check in for this reason! You have everything you need in the home. It’s extremely cozy. The view is incredible. What more could you ask for? I highly recommend staying here!',\n",
       " 'Great hosts - amazing space. Thank you!\\', \"My partner and I stayed with Jason & Ryan for 4 days while visiting San Francisco from the UK and I cannot recommend their place enough.\\\\nThey are both incredibly welcoming, the apartment is so clean and the bed is one of the comfiest we have ever slept in.\\\\nWe were welcomed with Beer, Wine and friendly faces!\\\\nJason\\'s knowledge on the best places to visit and local restaurants is beyond helpful.\\\\nI would 100% recommend their place as somewhere to stay if visiting the area!\", \"Jason\\'s place was very clean and accommodating. Jason guided us in when we became lost and helped with more than one journey to bring up our luggage. Parking is definitely a challenge, but Jason and Ryan helped us locate a safe place to park. Jason had treats and wine awaiting and talked to us about some things to do around the city and just general conversation, which was pleasant and appreciated. He is interested in meeting the unique needs of his guests to the extent possible and preferred. This is a private bedroom in their home with a bathroom that is exclusive to the guests and the rest of the space is shared. Understandably, it is important to Jason that guests are not planning to have social gatherings in the space, no parties, or other late-night activities that may disrupt/offend them or their neighbors. I would recommend this for folks who are traveling for business and like to turn in early\", \"Jason and Ryan made me feel comfortable and right at home. Had time to talk and get to know them, and theybare extremely kind and professional people. A beautiful home, wonderful view of the city, a warm and cozy room, a spotless bathroom, I couldn\\'t have asked for a nicer place to stay. Thank you for the conversation and all the local recommendations for food and places to visit. Would absolutely stay again.\", \\'Always great - great company, great place, great to deal with. Will definitely be back!',\n",

       " 'I recently stayed at Jason and Ryan’s Airbnb in San Francisco, and it was a fantastic experience. The home offers breathtaking views of the city and is ideally located for exploring SF. Jason and Ryan were exceptional hosts, providing great recommendations for local spots and ensuring a comfortable and inviting stay. The home was beautifully decorated, clean, and had all the amenities needed. I highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting San Francisco!',\n",
       " 'We had a lovely stay at Jason’s in San Francisco. Their apartment is perfectly located. We got very clear instructions on how to find the place and on how to get in using an app on your phone. Moreover, Jason was very easy to contact for any questions. There are quite some steps to get to the front door, but it is also San Francisco. In the apartment we had a nice big bedroom and our own guest bathroom. For breakfast we could use anything available in the kitchen (including the fridge). At our arrival we had a nice glass of wine with Jason, and he gave us some very good recommendation on where to go and which restaurants to try. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay with free parking in the streets around the apartment.',\n",
       " 'Jason and Ryan were superb hosts. They really helped make our trip what it was. The suite was clean, bed was comfy, we had everything we needed and more. Jason and Ryan offered great suggestions as what to see when in San Fransisco and provided a great space to come back home to.',\n",
       " 'Second time in a year coming to San Francisco. Second time staying with Jason. Great place to stay, with great location and very pleasant and thoughtful hosts.\\', \"Lovely views and the perfect way to feel like you are living in San Francisco while visiting.\\\\nThe place was easy to access & clean. Centrally located for a 5-20 min drive to many of the different places in the city. The only thing we had difficulty with was finding parking close to the home. Definitely not a reason not to stay though!\\\\nI\\'d stay again if visiting the area.\", \\'Thanks Jason and Ryan! We really enjoyed our stay at their house.',\n",

       " 'Jason and Ryan were lovely hosts. Parking and accessing the apartment were both slightly difficult, but Jason sent detailed instructions that made them a breeze. I’d recommend getting to the place and parked for the first time in the daylight, as that makes everything easier. The location was fantastic—within walking distance to all of the fun that the Castro offers. Jason also provided many extra touches—like a detailed binder with recommendations— that made the experience nicer. The apartment also had an amazing view of the city. Next time we come to the city, we’ll definitely see if Jason and Ryan are still hosting—this made our trip to the city so much more comfortable!',\n",
       " '- In town for a conference.\\\\n- Jason and Ryan are indeed Superhost and very accommodating to your plans.\\\\n- Great view from balcony to take in the SF skyline and morning sun.\\\\n- Bus station is right outside the place.

       " 'Wonderful stay in a great area of the city! Very accessible via transit. Jason was an excellent host with awesome recommendations. Would definitely book again!\\', \"I really enjoyed staying with Jason and Ryan. They are very friendly hosts who make the place very welcoming. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable I\\'ve ever had at an Airbnb; the bathroom was spotless with everything needed; and the balcony offered a beautiful view of the city. If you\\'re in SF, I would highly recommend staying here!\", \\'We LOVED our stay in Jason and Ryan’s home. Their hospitality was above and beyond, I’ve never had a host like them. And the room and bed were very comfy, sheets so soft. Heated toilet seat was a bonus. When we arrived, we shared a bottle of wine with them and chatted on their patio overlooking a magnificent view of the city. Truly breathtaking. We walked to the mission a couple of times and hiked up to Twin Peaks as well. Such a great location. One thing to note: you need to climb a significant brick stairwell to get up to their front door. If you’re carrying a super heavy suitcase, you may want a second hand going up and down. We had 2 smaller suitcases and wore sneakers, so we were fine with it. Would love to come stay again! Thanks Jason and Ryan!',\n",

The stay was very comfortable, home-y, and had spectacular views. It will most definitely be hard to top such incredible hosts in the city!\\', \"We had a great time at Jason\\'s place! The airbnb was extremely clean and has a newly renovated private bathroom. Detailed instructions made the check-in and check-out very easy. Jason and Ryan were wonderful hosts. Would definitely recommend!\", \\'Always great and always roll out the red carpet. It’s a home away from home and these guys are great! I’ll be back. :)\\', \"Jason\\'s place is really nice and cozy. Everything is spotless and modern.The linens are cleaned and smell nice. The bed was VERY comfortable and I had restful and quiet nights. Climbing the four steep flights of stairs for the first time was a bit daunting, but well worth it. Just make sure to switch on the lights at night.\\\\nAlso, the skyline view from the balcony is simply BREATHTAKING and I enjoyed relaxing there...especially at night. The property is well located in San Francisco. The Castro neighborhood as well as Dolores Park are pretty close by and easy to get to on foot. There\\'s also a bus station nearly to get around. Finally, the fans and wireless charging pads in the bedroom were nice touches.\", \\'If Jason’s place is available book it and don’t think twice. It is perfect for a couple or solo traveler and has breathtaking views. It’s exactly as pictured and very clean and cozy. Jason is the ultimate host very responsive and proactive. He made us feel at home even days before we arrived. I would definitely book again!',\n",

The stairs could pose an issue for those with mobility problems but that can be said for all of San Francisco! Jason and Ryan were great hosts.',\n",
       " 'Jason is the best Airbnb host I’ve yet experienced!! Every detail is considered for guests, from impeccable communications & helping us feel prepared for arrival, to wine on the counter & breakfast / snack offerings throughout your stay. The home is kept in pristine condition, a welcome guide greets you along with a bottle of wine when you enter, everything is labeled and very clearly designated for our ease of stay. The toilet has a bidet; and like Jason, is even warm \\\\U0001f979 he offers friendly conversation and respects your need for rest if that is more a priority, and he even helped me re-park my car so I could sleep in and carried up my heavy luggage ☺️ hope his partner is there next time to meet!
